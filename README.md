# Smart Irrigation System with Temperature Sensor

Welcome to the Smart Irrigation System with Temperature Sensor project! This project utilizes an Atmega32 AVR microcontroller to intelligently control a center pivot irrigation system in a greenhouse. The system is designed to water the plants twice a day, in the morning and evening, while also adjusting the watering speed based on the temperature sensed in the greenhouse. This helps optimize water usage and plant health.

## Project Requirements
