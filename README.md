# Smart Irrigation System with Temperature Sensor

Welcome to the Smart Irrigation System with Temperature Sensor project! This project utilizes an Atmega32 AVR microcontroller to intelligently control a center pivot irrigation system in a greenhouse. The system is designed to water the plants twice a day, in the morning and evening, while also adjusting the watering speed based on the temperature sensed in the greenhouse. This helps optimize water usage and plant health.

## Project Requirements

To replicate this project, you will need the following components:

- Atmega32 AVR microcontroller
- Temperature sensor
- Relay
- Solenoid valve
- Power supply
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the Smart Irrigation System:

1. Connect the Atmega32 AVR microcontroller to the breadboard.
2. Attach the temperature sensor to the appropriate pins on the microcontroller.
3. Connect the relay to the microcontroller to control the solenoid valve.
4. Connect the solenoid valve to the relay for water flow control.
5. Connect the power supply to both the microcontroller and the solenoid valve to provide power.
6. Ensure all connections are secure and double-check the wiring.

## Usage Instructions

To use the Smart Irrigation System:

1. Upload the provided code to the Atmega32 AVR microcontroller.
2. Set your desired watering times within the code.
3. Power on the system by turning on the power supply.
4. The system will now autonomously water the plants at the specified times.
5. The system will also adjust the water flow based on the temperature to account for varying plant needs.
